title:  "Nodes and Edges"
layout: section

<p>In the previous page, I said graph theory boils down to <strong>places to go, and ways to get there.</strong>  Let's have another look at the definition I used earlier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A graph refers to a collection of <strong>nodes</strong> and a collection of <strong>edges</strong> that connect pairs of nodes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  <strong>Nodes:</strong>  Places to be <br />
  <strong>Edges:</strong>  Ways to get there

</p>

<p>In the KÃ¶nigsberg example, the land masses and islands are nodes, and the bridges are edges.</p>
