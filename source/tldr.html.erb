<h1><abbr title="Too Long; Didn't Read">TL;DR</abbr></h1>

<ul class="full-size">
  <li>Git is an incredibly powerful tool, but it can be hard to learn.</li>
  <li>It helps to know something about <%= section_link('graph theory') %>, especially with regard to <%= section_link('reachability') %>.</li>
  <li>And to know what Git's <%= section_link('references') %> are.</li>
  <li>Because <strong><%= section_link('references make commits reachable') %>.</strong> <br /><em>(Only got time to read one page?  Make it that one.)</em></li>
  <li>Once you understand that, you won't waste so much time backing up your entire repository, <%= section_link('my-humble-beginnings', 'like I did') %>.</li>
  <li><%= section_link('use-your-targeting-computer-luke', 'I like GitX') %>, and you can use it (or another visualizer) to bootstrap your knowledge of Git.</li>
  <li>I've got a few recipes for <%= section_link('testing out merges') %> that give you an "undo" option.</li>
  <li>And I've attempted to explain <%= section_link('rebase-from-the-ground-up', 'rebase') %> as simply as I can.</li>
</ul>
