<p><strong>This is a perfect example of the form.</strong>  It sounds impressive, but unless you already know what the author is talking about, it doesn't really help.</p>

  I like this tweet for another reason.  I've purchased and read several of Kent's books, and had assumed that he already knew everything there was to know.  When I saw this, and realized that I'd understood something before him, I was quite surprised. And then I was amused at having been surprised.
