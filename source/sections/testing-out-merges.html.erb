<p>These days, I sling branches around without really thinking much about it.  But the first few times I tried using different branches to develop features, it was a bit nerve-wracking.  If that's where you are, what follows are two simple recipes that should help you play around with <code class="inline">git merge</code> until you understand exactly what it does.</p>

<p>I've put together two slight variations on the same operation.  Both techniques basically do the same thing, but one of them relies on a slightly scarier-sounding Git command for the undo.</p>

<p>You might prefer one or the other based on how uncertain you areâ€”about either your Git skills, or the specific merge you're about to try.</p>

<ul class="full-size">
  <li>
    
    Use <%= section_link('the Scout pattern') %> if you're still unclear on exactly what <code class="inline">git merge</code> does, or if you think it's likely that you'll decide to back out of the merge.
  
  </li>
  <li>
    
    Use <%= section_link 'the Savepoint pattern' %> if you're pretty sure what you want to do, but just want to leave yourself an undo button in case things get too messy.
  
  </li>
</ul>
