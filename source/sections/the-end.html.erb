<blockquote style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.2em;">Where do we go from here?<br />
Where do we go from here?<br />
The battle's done, and we kind of won<br />
So we sound our victory cheer<br />
Where do we go from here?<br /><br />
<strong>–Buffy the Vampire Slayer, "Once More, With Feeling"</strong>
